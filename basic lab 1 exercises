## Write a program that prompts the user to enter an area of a circle as a floating point number and prints the corresponding radius. 
## Round the result to one decimal place. Note: you can assume that the user enters a valid value.

area = float(input('Enter an area of a circle: '))

pi = 3.142 
radius = ((area / pi)**0.5)
print('The radius is ' + str(round(radius,1)))
